# E-commerce Analysis & Machine Learning

## Objective
Analyze transaction-level e-commerce data to identify key drivers of profitability and evaluate machine learning models for profit prediction.

## Dataset
Real-world e-commerce dataset containing sales, discounts, product categories, and profit information.

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R²

## Key Insights
- High discounts (>40%) consistently resulted in negative profit
- Sales volume alone did not guarantee profitability
- Technology products generated the highest average profit
- Certain furniture sub-categories contributed disproportionately to losses

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Outcome
While profit prediction accuracy was limited due to missing cost-related features, the project delivered strong business insights and highlighted the importance of strategic discounting and data-driven decision making.
